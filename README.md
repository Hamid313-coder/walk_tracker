## Functionality
This app (Walk Tracker) is a sport app which tracks the user location, shows that on the map and counts user's walking steps.
For the first time user specifies his/her height and gender for calculating the exact user step distance in order to calculate the distance which user passes by walking. Then the user can set the number steps that wants to walk in the next page. After that it goes to map page which starts tracking user location and calculating users' steps number and the distance which is passed by the user. Finally it goes to congratulation page when the uer completes the number of steps that set. Then user can start walking again.
